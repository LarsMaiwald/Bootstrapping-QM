# Bootstrapping-QM

The code in this repository was created by Lars Maiwald and Kevin Siebert as part of the M.Sc. Physics Research Lab at FSU Jena.
We developed two new algorithms for reducing computational effort in Bootstrapping quantum mechanics.

The project is to be understood as a __proof of concept__.
